## 🛠 Features & Modules  

### 🌱 1. Crop Recommendation  
- Suggests the best crops to grow based on **soil quality, climate, and past yield data**.  
- Uses **machine learning models** trained on various soil and environmental factors.  
- Helps optimize **land use and increase yield** by selecting suitable crops.  

### 🦠 2. Disease Detection  
- Uses **image processing and deep learning** to detect **crop diseases**.  
- Farmers can **upload an image of a diseased plant**, and the system predicts the type of disease.  
- Provides **treatment suggestions** to mitigate damage.  

### 🌾 3. Fertilizer Recommendation  
- Analyzes **soil nutrients and crop type** to recommend the best fertilizers.  
- Helps farmers **reduce unnecessary fertilizer usage**, preventing soil degradation.  
- Ensures **better crop health** and **cost savings**.  

### 🐛 4. Pest Detection  
- Uses **computer vision and AI** to identify common pests affecting crops.  
- Helps in **early pest detection** to prevent large-scale damage.  
- Suggests **eco-friendly pest control measures**.  

### ⛅ 5. Weather Alert System  
- Provides **real-time weather updates and alerts** to farmers.  
- Helps plan agricultural activities based on **rainfall, temperature, and humidity forecasts**.  
- Minimizes losses due to **unexpected weather changes**.
